=======

djmount - mount MediaServers content as a Linux filesystem.
Created 23/04/2005, Rémi Turboult <r3mi@users.sourceforge.net>


djmount is a UPnP AV client. It mounts as a Linux filesystem (using FUSE)
the media content of compatible UPnP AV devices (see "Known Compatible Devices"
paragraph below).

djmount discovers automatically all UPnP AV Media Servers on the network,
and make the content available in a directory tree. All shared files 
(e.g. Audio or Video files) are directly visible and can be played using 
your favorite media player.


djmount is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GNU GPL : see "COPYING" file) : see details in "Copyright and 
Licenses" paragraph below.


Example
-------

(the actual content listed depends on your AV files collection !)

$ djmount /mnt/av

$ cd /mnt/av

$ ls -l
dr-xr-xr-x  3 root root 512 jan  1  2000 SomeMediaServerDeviceName/
dr-xr-xr-x  3 root root 512 jan  1  2000 AnotherMediaServerDeviceName/
-r--r--r--  1 root root 114 jan  1  2000 devices

$ cd SomeMediaServerDeviceName

$ ls -l 
dr-xr-xr-x  5 root root  512 jan  1  2000 browse/
-r--r--r--  1 root root 1749 jan  1  2000 status

$ ls -l browse/
dr-xr-xr-x  14 root root 512 jan  1  2000 Music/
dr-xr-xr-x   5 root root 512 jan  1  2000 Pictures/
dr-xr-xr-x   4 root root 512 jan  1  2000 Videos/

$ ls -l browse/Music/Artists/Tinariwen/
-r--r--r--  1 root root 5407087 jan  1  2000 Chatma.mp3
-r--r--r--  1 root root     722 jan  1  2000 Chatma.xml
-r--r--r--  1 root root 3751143 jan  1  2000 Chet Boghassa.mp3
-r--r--r--  1 root root     729 jan  1  2000 Chet Boghassa.xml

$ xmms browse/Music/Artists/Tinariwen/

$ fusermount -u /mnt/av


Note: the FUSE  kernel module shall be loaded before running djmount 
(otherwise you will get the error: 
"fusermount: fuse device not found, try 'modprobe fuse' first").


Building and Installation
-------------------------

djmount has been built and tested on the following configurations:

* MandrakeLinux 10.1 (kernel 2.6.8.1-12mdk, gcc 3.4.1, glibc-2.3.3), 
  FUSE 2.2.1, 2.4.0, 2.5.0, 2.5.2 or 2.5.3, libupnp internal or 1.3.1

* GeeXboX 0.98.7 (Linux kernel 2.6.14, gcc 3.4.4, uClibc 0.9.28),
  FUSE 2.4.1

* Debian sid (Linux kernel 2.6.14, gcc 4.0.3 20051023 prerelease)

* Ubuntu 5.10 "Breezy Badger" (Linux kernel 2.6.12-9-386, gcc 4.0.2 20050808 
  prerelease, libc6 2.3.5-1ubuntu12), FUSE 2.4.2



A) Basic build instruction:

1) Prerequisites for compilation:

   * the FUSE package : http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ 

2) Use 'configure' and 'make' in the top directory to compile.
   Example :
	./configure
	make

3) if you want to install djmount on your system, run :
	make install

   or to strip the resulting executable :
	make install-strip


B) Advanced build instruction:

"configure" as a few options to customise djmount: see --help option.
In particular,
	
  --disable-debug             extra debugging code [default=enabled]
  --with-fuse-prefix=DIR      search for fuse in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR  search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --with-external-talloc      use external talloc library (not recommended)
                              [default = use internal bundled library]
  --with-talloc-prefix=DIR    search for talloc in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --with-external-libupnp     use external libupnp library (at least 1.3.1)
                              [default = use internal bundled library]
  --with-libupnp-prefix=DIR   search for libupnp in DIR/include and DIR/lib

configure with also checks the following environment variables in
case there is a custom installation (see also configure --help):
	FUSE_CFLAGS, FUSE_LIBS, 
	TALLOC_CFLAGS, TALLOC_LIBS, 
	LIBUPNP_CFLAGS, LIBUPNP_LIBS.

Examples:
	./configure --with-external-talloc --with-talloc-prefix=/opt/local
	TALLOC_CFLAGS='-I/opt/include' ./configure --with-external-talloc

Note: djmount requires the patches included in the bundled libupnp library :
version 1.2.1a alone is not sufficient. If using an external libupnp 
installation, it must be at least version 1.3.1.


Usage 
-----

1) as root : load the FUSE kernel module

	modprobe fuse

2) To run, simply use the 'djmount' executable
   (no extra file is needed).
   The FUSE mountpoint is a required argument. For example:

	djmount /mnt/upnp

3) when finished, unmount the mountpoint (see details in FUSE documentation):

	fusermount -u /mnt/upnp

4) Options :
   see "djmount --help" for the complete list of options.
   A useful option is "-o" which can set mount options, in particular:
 
   "-o iocharset=<charset>" for proper encoding of filenames, in case djmount 
   has not autodetected your settings (which should be the default).
   Example :
	djmount -o iocharset=iso-8859-15 /mnt/upnp

   "-o playlists" to render all Audio or Video files as playlists (.m3u or 
   .ram), which contains an URL for the file. In this mode, only the address 
   of the file is exported through djmount ; the actual content is streamed 
   through HTTP when the playlist is accessed by your favorite media player.
   This mode was the only mode possible for djmount before version 0.50.


Known Compatible Devices
------------------------

djmount has been tested successfully with the following UPnP AV 
Devices / Media Servers. Although djmount should work with other 
UPnP AV compliant devices, help is needed to test on additional devices.


* TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server ( http://www.twonkyvision.de )
  versions 2.7.2, 2.9.1, 3.0 and 3.1 for Linux are ok

* GMediaServer on Linux ( http://www.gnu.org/software/gmediaserver/ )
  versions 0.7.0 and 0.9.0 (version 0.8.0 not ok)

* Ahead Nero MediaHome Server ( http://www.nero.com/en/Nero_MediaHome.html )
  included in Nero ultra 6.6

* Microsoft Windows Media Connect 
  ( http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/wmconnect/ )
  requires Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) and .NET FrameWork 1.1. 

* GeeXboX uShare on Linux ( http://ushare.geexbox.org/ )
  versions 0.9.3 to 0.9.7

* AV Media Server in Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies (.NET), 
  ( http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/downloads/upnp/tools/index.htm )
  version 1.0.1768.24080 (Build 1768)

* Nokia N93 phone


This page describes how to share A/V content with some of the above servers :
 http://www.geexbox.org/wiki/index.php/Accessing_to_UPnP_Contents

Warning : if your UPnP Media Server is behind a closed firewall, it won't be 
visible in djmount. Therefore, if there is a firewall on the machine
where you are running your media server, you have to open the necessary
ports in this firewall. Some media servers can do it automatically 
(e.g. Windows Media Connect on Windows XP), most of them don't do it 
(e.g. AV Media Server in Intel Tools).


Implementation
--------------

This project uses the following main libraries :

* the FUSE package ( http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ ), 

* the Linux SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp), initially created by Intel:
  http://upnp.sourceforge.net/ .
  "djmount" is bundled with a copy of this library (in the "libupnp" 
  directory), with some mandatory patches.

* the "talloc" library : http://talloc.samba.org/
  "djmount" is bundled with a copy of this library, for convenience.

* for testing only (test_upnp executable) : "readline" library (optionnal)


The UPnP AV Architecture is described here :
