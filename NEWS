What is new in 0.50

* major change : the content of all files is now directly shared by djmount,
  instead of playlists e.g. MP3 files are directly visible, instead of M3U 
  files. This allow : 
    - seeking A/V files in media players not supporting seeks in HTTP streams,
    - accessing files without playlist formats e.g. images.
  Known limitation : files larger than 2 Gb are not always treated correctly.

  The old djmount behaviour (sharing of playlists) can still be obtained using
  the "-o playlists" mount option (only for A/V files though).

  Note: this change requires using FUSE >= 2.4

* configure: add new --disable-charset option to suppress all character 
  conversion code (i.e. assume everything is in UTF-8)

* fix crash when browsing GeeXboX uShare 0.9.3 (empty directory name)

* fix potential corruption of filenames with international characters

* fix: relative paths to mount points are now working in daemon mode 
  (reported by Andre Landwehr)

* code refactoring and miscellaneous code improvements.

============================================================================

What is new in 0.40

* new build system : standard autoconf + automake support for all packages,
  including bundled libupnp.

* tested ok with GeeXboX uShare ( http://ushare.geexbox.org/ )

* fix: additional checks and logs for devices with incorrect ServiceType 
  or ServiceId values

============================================================================

What is new in 0.31

* fix small memory leak when reading '/devices' file

* include additional debugging information in 'status' files, 
  to help diagnostic in case of failure

* updated README to indicate that djmount has been tested ok with 
  FUSE 2.4.0, Windows Media Connect, Nero MediaHome

============================================================================

What is new in 0.30

* full i18n charset support, either with iconv (when available), or internally
  (limited to utf8 and 8bits charsets cpxxx and iso-8859-xxx).

* fix running in daemon mode (default if not -f or -d flag)
  (bug reported by Benjamin Zores)

* fix discovery of new device when DeviceType is empty

* fix printing of UPnP port number after initialisation 
  (bug reported by Benjamin Zores)

* add colorization of debug log output, depending on severity

============================================================================

What is new in 0.25

* preliminary i18n charset support

* tested on Linux with TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server and GMediaServer 

============================================================================

What is new in 0.20

* Network caching has been implemented for basic browsing,
  so performances for large media collections are a lot better.

* Still only tested with TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server.

============================================================================

What is new in 0.10

* first (alpha) release

* Basic browsing is implemented, but there is no network caching yet,
